 * @param clientBypass For routers shared with the client portal (tasks/
 *                     todos/meetings/messages) where role 'client' must
 *                     always pass regardless of admin configuration, because
 *                     portal access is governed by denyClientWrites +
 *                     controller-level ownership scoping, not this system.
 *                     Never set this on a feature the client shouldn't reach
